    <center><h1>Travel</h1></center><hr>
    <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations.
       Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane,
       ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.
       Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. 
        The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.
        According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. 
        It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) 
        and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).</p>

    <h2>Purpose and Motivation</h2>
    <p>Reasons for traveling include recreation,holidays, rejuvenation, tourism or vacationing,
       research travel, the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, 
       migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, 
       trade, commuting, obtaining health care, waging or fleeing war, for the enjoyment of traveling, or other reasons.
       Travelers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or vehicles, such as public transport,
       automobiles, trains, ferries, boats, cruise ships and airplanes.</p>
    <h3>Motives for travel include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pleasure</li>
        <li>Relaxation</li>
        <li>Discovery and exploration</li>
        <li>Adventure</li>
        <li>Intercultural Communications</li>
        <li>Taking personal time for building interpersonal relationships</li>
        <li>Avoiding Stress</li>
        <li>Forming memories</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.
        While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended 
        to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. <br> Humankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World from Spain in 1492,
        an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United States overnight.</p>
    
    <h2>Safety</h2>
